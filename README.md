# ask-me-anything

I am a back-end developer that does a lot of serverless things in AWS. You can find out more about me here or on https://neverendingqs.com/.

Got a question for me? Throw it into a [discussion topic](https://github.com/neverendingqs/ask-me-anything/discussions) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible!

Interested in seeing a code example from me? Add an [issue](https://github.com/neverendingqs/ask-me-anything/issues) or upvote one to request one!

## Question Ideas

* Ask me about a [Serverless Framework plugin I maintain](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aneverendingqs+topic%3Aserverless-plugin&type=repositories) or about plugins in general
* I like poking around with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aneverendingqs+topic%3Agithub-actions&type=repositories) and have a set of personal [workflow templates](https://github.com/neverendingqs/.github/tree/master/workflow-templates) I maintain
